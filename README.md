# gsad-x

gsad-x is an experimental prototype for serving [gvmd](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm)
data via [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It is intended as a long term
replacement for [gsad](https://github.com/greenbone/gsa/tree/master/gsad).

## Installation

Just run
```
yarn
```

to install all dependencies.

The GraphQL server can be started with

```
yarn start
```

Afterwards the server will listen on http://localhost:4000/graphql
